# Final Integrated Project
For MMED-1053, MMED-1051, MMED-1050, MMED-1054 & MMED-1052.

## Requirements
For this project, I chose to design a website for a business of my own creation, “The Village Keeper”, that sells Christmas village collectibles. On the site, you will find three live pages – the home page, products page and contact page. In the project folders, you will find my logo creation, original photography and various other assets used to create this project.

## The Village Keeper: Christmas Collectibles
About the Company: From the old-style houses and shops to the old-fashioned outfits of the figurines, The Village Keeper collection is one that depicts the holidays in an earlier time period, that of the horse and buggy era. Each piece has been expertly designed to capture a unique moment frozen in time. Passed down from generation to generation, it is The Village Keeper’s hope that these collection pieces continue to spread joy and Christmas spirit during the holidays.
